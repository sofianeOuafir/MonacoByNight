<h4>Description</h4>

This project has be done during my last year at university. 

I had fun doing that iOS app.

With that project, I have learned doing some xml file and image caching thanks to Carlos and sdWebImage frameworks.

I have manipulated the tableViewcontroller. 

I have also done a form and use the NSRegularExpression Object to control the user's input.
MoreOver, I have manipulated the webviewController.

Finally, I also learned how to load the right data according to the system language.
