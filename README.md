This project has be done during my last year at university. I had fun doing that iOS app.
With that project, I have learned doing some xml file and image caching thanks to Carlos and sdWebImage frameworks.
I have manipulated the tableViewcontroller. I have also done a form and use the NSRegularExpression Object to control the user's input.
Finally, I also learned how to load the right data according to the system language.
